Our solutions includes the following services

### ✔ ADVISORY SERVICES

At Decentral Solutions, we provide ICO and blockchain advisory and consultation services, along with software development services to businesses using blockchain technologies. Our partners can use Decentral Solutions’ Blockchain technology expertise to deliver innovative services to the global token market. 

We work closely with your company to develop best-in-class token marketing documents, and pairing this with our diverse group of ICO PR partners to tailor the message to different investor classes and international hubs to help increase revenue generation & token sales.

We offer technical whitepaper due diligence, smart contract auditing, developer support and technical guidance to prepare your Blockchain based business for its ICO. We provide you the direct support of the engagement managers and development team in one of the United States’ best advisory firms.

We believe in our process of Goal Definition, Analysis and Implementation. We perform private and public code audits for organizations. We review smart contracts and application code, and write an actionable report of every issue found. The report outlines potential problems in the code, additional recommendations to increase security, and general analysis of the contract dynamics reflecting state-of-the-art security platforms. The report is sent privately so you can address the issues we found, and prepare a disclosure strategy.  We have expertise in auditing Solidity, EVM assembly, JavaScript, Python and Bitcoin Scripting code.


### ✔ SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AUDIT

We audit your contracts to identify vulnerable code, whether it’s logic flaws, using unsafe design patterns, or not following best practices. The report from the audit can be publicly referenced and shared with your investors to instill confidence.   

Smart contracts provide a way to programatically govern relationships between one or more entities without the need for a middleman. The security implications of this new paradigm are far reaching, leading to new classes of vulnerabilities in code. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts have cumulatively cost the cryptocurrency ecosystem hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. We help to identify security flaws in your contracts before they are deployed into a production environment.    

We employ an industry standard methodology that uses a number of different techniques to identify security issues.  

- Static analysis
- Dynamic analysis  
- Manual code review
- Manual testing 

The audit report can either be used privately to secure the contracts before handling funds, or it can be made public on the iosiro website. Public reports can be shared with potential investors to provide a third party perspective on the security of the contracts, providing them with peace of mind. 

### ✔ PENETRATION TESTING

A system is only as strong as its weakest link. The importance of securing off-chain systems, such as registration services or promotional websites, is often overlooked. iosiro can help by testing systems to identify and remedy security vulnerabilities before attackers discover them.

### ✔ SECURE STORAGE PROCESS DESIGN

Balancing security with usability can be a challenging task when storing funds raised through a token sale. We help design a configuration that achieves the right balance for you through multisig, hot and cold, and hardware wallets. iosiro also provides training for staff members who need to access the funds to ensure that they understand how to keep the funds safe. 


### ✔ KYC/AML SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

Requirements for KYC/AML compliance differ between countries. Typically, a significant amount of security compliance is required, including minimum standards for encryption of data in transit and at rest, restricted access to customer information, and following security best practices. We help you address these concerns and can make recommendations around how best to implement security changes to your environment.



> Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) present a high level of risk to both organizers and investors. The large sums of cryptocurrencies raised during ICOs are an attractive target for attackers. Sensitive data collected during KYC processes adds additional risk that may deter potential investors from participating. 

> With years of experience in security, iosiro provides a turnkey ICO security solution that strengthens the security posture of systems used in ICOs. The solution addresses many of the threats posed during a typical token sale.
