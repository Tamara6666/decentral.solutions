### Overview
Decentral Solutions has worked with many customers to evaluate the security of their products and engineering practices.

### Solution
  
Decentral Solutions sits down with the clients engineering team to understand their business, architecture, existing code base, engineering practices, etc. 


We then write a detailed threat model including data flow diagrams, list of potential threats (details listed below), and mitigations. Finally we assisted customers in implementing changes to their code and their engineering practices to close the gaps.
