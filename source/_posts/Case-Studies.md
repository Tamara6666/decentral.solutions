## Creator AI

### Overview

A Startup Incubator based in Silicon Valley faced a recurring challenge centered around getting their incubatee companies to scale. Decentral Solutions started an engagement centered around a blockchain solution to decentralized content creation.


### Solution
Over the span of multiple weeks our team worked to make a broad, multi-faceted problem into a specific one. First we let the client fully define the problem in terms of his scope of expertise, which was building and scaling small startups. From those requirements we were able to provide a prototype whitepaper that details the necessary blockchain protocols needed to solve the content creation problem in each subdomain.

## iCash

### Overview
A US based security startup, commissioned Decentral Solutions to design an end-to-end digital identity solution that would enable customers to validate and share identity information. Traditionally this would involve sending ID documents over insecure channels (e.g. email) and expensive KYC and compliance processes. The client had a very tight timeframe for development.

### Solution
Within a few months Decentral Solutions developed an end-to-end solution supporting KYC providers, issuers, 3rd party application developers, and end-users. Our team started by designing a backend for issuers allowing them to validate individual information and generate digital certificates. The backend relied on an HSM (Hardware Security Module) for digital signing of certificates.

Our team then integrated the solution with different KYC providers enabling document recognition, and basic validation. The final solution supported a variety of IDs from over 190 countries. Finally Decentral Solutions built end user portals that focused on digital identity wallet for iOS and Android devices. The wallets leveraged mobile phone secure element processors to sign all transactions in hardware ensuring high levels of security. 


## Quantstamp

### Overview
Decentral Solutions has worked with many customers to evaluate the security of their products and engineering practices.

### Solution
  
Decentral Solutions sits down with the clients engineering team to understand their business, architecture, existing code base, engineering practices, etc. 

We then write a detailed threat model including data flow diagrams, list of potential threats (details listed below), and mitigations. Finally we assisted customers in implementing changes to their code and their engineering practices to close the gaps.


| Attack                   | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancey exploit      | Certain exploits allows functions to be re-entered before its termination, which can then be used circumvent restrictions e.g. DAO hack.            |
| Memory access violation  | It's possible to push a variable's pointer outside the range of its closure, thus allowing the exploiter to access or mutate mission critical data. |
| Stack size limit         | Functions can be written that when invoked causes the EVM to overflow. Call stack exceeds maximum size and the method throws.                       |
| State mutability         | Lack of function closures and improper use of global variables lead to state conflicts, intermittent failures and race conditions                   |
| Block time dependencies  | Miners can exploit contracts that depend on parametrized blocktimes, when there is an economic incentive.                                           |
| Deterministic randomness | Programming a contract to meet a random condition can be exploited if random number is generated by a pseudorandom function.                        |
| Type casts               | When types are not enforced or used properly, unexpected behavior may result e.g. arithmetic overflows.                                             |
| Ether voids              | Ether sent to the wrong address are lost forever, contracts that do not detect when recipient is an orphaned address.                               |
| Call to the unknown      | When a contract has a function that invokes an atypical fallback, e.g. self destruct in the Parity Multisig Wallet Hack                             |
| Exception disorder       | Non-standardized behavior for errors and exception handling.                                                                                        |
| Gas limit                | When a contract method call requires more gas than the maximum allowed per transaction.
